About the Project
This project is part of a broader effort by our micro-finance startup to provide accessible, community-driven financial tools aimed at empowering low-income individuals. As a company, we are committed to financial inclusion and believe that access to clear, understandable financial services can create real change in underserved communities.

To support this mission, we are gradually modernizing our development workflow to make our tools more collaborative, transparent, and scalable. This project—a basic script to calculate simple interest—marks the first step in that transition.

Purpose
The Simple Interest Calculator serves two main goals:

Support Financial Education and Access
Simple interest is one of the most fundamental concepts in finance. By creating a tool to demonstrate how it’s calculated, we aim to support our users' understanding of borrowing, saving, and planning their finances.

Initiate Our Migration to Modern Development Practices
Our current systems are managed using Subversion (SVN), but as we grow, we’re moving toward more flexible and community-friendly tools. This script is our starting point for that transition. It’s a small, manageable example that helps us adopt better practices while remaining true to our mission.

Features
Straightforward calculation of simple interest

Clear, readable code meant for education and collaboration

A foundation for future development of financial tools

Project Values
We’re not just writing code—we’re building a culture of openness, responsibility, and collaboration. That’s why this project also includes:

A Code of Conduct to foster a respectful environment
